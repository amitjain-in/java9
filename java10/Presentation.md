Overview

Java 9 Project Jigsaw - Introduction to modules.

The future projects
Project Amber: Language changes, including type inference mentioned above, but also pattern matching and more.
Project Loom: Support for lightweight threads called fibres, and continuations for easier asynchronous coding.
Project Metropolis: Code part of the JVM runtime itself in Java.
Project Panama: Improve interop with native code via a new Native InterConnect Layer.
Project Valhalla: Value types for more efficient code when primitive types are not suitable and object types too expensive.
